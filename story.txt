There was once a barnacle that lived on a whales back in the Atlantic.

Everything was going good for that barnacle. However, on one fateful day, 
the barnacle fell off of the whale's back and began to sink to the bottom
of the ocean. It appeared as if all was lost for that barnacle.

But then the barnacle realized this was its call to action and the 
beginning of act 2 of its story. It sank to the bottom of the sea where it found a chest full of treasure.
